CornerstoneWLA.org
=========================
Thanks for helping us build [CornerstoneWLA.org](http://cornerstonewla.org)! The structure of the site is based on the excellent [Skeleton WP Theme](https://github.com/simplethemes/skeleton_wp) from [SimpleThemes](http://simplethemes.com). It is built to be clean, intuitive, and responsive.

Here's what you need to do to get started...

Getting Started
-------------------------
If you're totally new to things, you'll first need to [set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) & familiarize yourself with the basics somewhere like [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) or [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics).

Once you've got everything set up, just clone our repository & make your first commit:
		
>```$ git clone git://github.com/CornerstoneWLA/cwla-site.git myproject```

>```$ git add .```

>```$ git commit -m "Initial commit"```

Easy peasy!

Set Up WordPress
-------------------------
You'll need to run a local server like [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) & a MySQL database to get WordPress running smoothly on your machine. If you need help with this, check out the [codex entry](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_Locally_on_Your_Mac_With_MAMP) on the subject.

After you're created your database, all that's left is to create your local configuration file and add your database name to it. You'll find a template in `config/wp-config-sample.local.php` -- just copy this file, enter your info, and rename as `wp-config.local.php`.

Start Coding
-------------------------
All that's left is to start writing code! Once your changes have been pushed to Github, just submit a pull request so that we can integrate your code with our repository.

Alternatively, you can always just [send us your username](mailto:admin@cornerstonewla.org) if you want to be added as a member of the CWLA organization for ongoing future updates.
